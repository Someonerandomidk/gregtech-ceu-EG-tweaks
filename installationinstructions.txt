2.-Run the game 1 time so it generates the necessary files
3.-copy all the files that end with ZS(or just everything that is not the "lang" folder if you dont see any ZS at the end), go to the folder where your minecraft is stored OR .minecraft and paste them on the "scripts" folder
4.-Copy the "lang" folder and go to .minecraft or where your minecraft is located, then go to groovy/assets/placeholdername/lang and paste it inside the "lang" folder, basically replace the auto-generated "en-us" file
